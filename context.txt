Designed and built a comprehensive AI-driven career development platform that moves beyond simple resume generation to offer strategic career management. Leveraging Gemma-27B-IT and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), CareerVector acts as an intelligent agent that aligns a user’s entire professional history with their target roles.

Key Features:

The Vault (Master Profile): A centralized, vector-embedded source of truth for all career data (experience, skills, education) that persists across applications.
Match Engine (RAG): Uses semantic vector search to analyze job descriptions and generate hyper-tailored, ATS-optimized resumes by retrieving the most relevant experience chunks from the Vault.
Gap Engine (Strategic Analysis): Performs deep-dive gap analysis between a user's profile and target roles, identifying specific skill deficiencies and readiness scores.
AI Learning Agent: Integrates live web search (via Gemini Pro) to automatically curate and recommend active upskilling courses from Coursera, Udemy, and top universities that directly bridge identified skill gaps.
Admin & Analytics: Built a secured admin dashboard to monitor user quotas, match history, and performance metrics.
Tech Stack:

Core: React, Vite, Tailwind CSS
AI/ML: Google Gemini API (2.5 Pro & Gemma), Gemini Embeddings (gemini-embedding-001), LangChain
Backend: Firebase (Firestore, Auth, Hosting, Functions)
Architecture: Serverless RAG Pipeline, Vector Database
